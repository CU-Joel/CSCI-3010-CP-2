1.) Plan from previous HW:

Improve the look and functionality of the GUI, develop testing and attempt to add network functionality. If networking is too hard (which it probably will be), I will try to make an executable version of the game for Mac and Windows so it can be played outside of the Qt creator. 

2.) What I accomplished:

I improved some aspects of the gameplay such as the algorithms for the computer players and made the game playable on Mac, Linux and Windows

3.)Testing:

Testing for this game would be to test all the button combinations to see if the program crashed.
