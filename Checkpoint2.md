CSCI 3010 Ind. Project Checkpoint 2

1.) Plan from previous HW:

I will complete the game functionality in the GUI version of the game, add comments, add at least one level of difficulty and then move on to testing. Features that will be added to the game will be the ability to select the winning score to play to and the ability to select the difficulty of the game. I will have a method of testing the game using one of the testing frameworks that we went over in class.

2.) What I accomplished:

I finally got the GUI to work! You can now play a full game. I created a hard difficulty level and implemented a welcome menu screen that allows you to select the max score and difficulty level. It only has easy and hard currently.

3.)For next checkpoint:

Improve the look and functionality of the GUI, develop testing and attempt to add network functionality. If networking is too hard (which it probably will be), I will try to make an executable version of the game for Mac and Windows so it can be played outside of the Qt creator.
